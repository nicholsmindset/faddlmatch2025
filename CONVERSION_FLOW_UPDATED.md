3. **Success Message** → "Profile Complete! Now choose a plan..."
4. **Automatic Redirect** → Pricing page with conversion messaging

### 3. **Optimized Pricing Page**
Enhanced pricing page specifically for post-onboarding users:

```
🎉 You're Almost Ready to Find Your Match!

Your profile is complete. Now unlock powerful features to 
connect with compatible Islamic partners who share your 
values and life goals.
```
