## üîç Monitoring Dashboard Access

### Real-time Dashboard
```bash
# Get current health status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/monitoring-dashboard?metric_type=health"

# Get performance metrics for last 4 hours  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/monitoring-dashboard?timeframe=4h&metric_type=performance"

# Get error analysis
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/monitoring-dashboard?metric_type=errors"
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check current health status
SELECT * FROM function_health_status ORDER BY health_status DESC;

-- View active alerts
SELECT * FROM active_alerts ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Performance trends (last 24 hours)
SELECT * FROM function_performance_trends 
WHERE hour > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Error analysis
SELECT * FROM function_error_analysis 
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Procedures

### High Error Rate Alert

**Symptoms**: Error rate >5% in 5-minute window

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check error breakdown by function:
```sql
SELECT function_name, error_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM function_error_events 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
GROUP BY function_name, error_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

2. Check recent error details:
```sql
SELECT * FROM function_error_events 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
  AND severity IN ('high', 'critical')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

3. Identify patterns:
   - **Database connectivity**: Check Supabase status
   - **Authentication issues**: Verify Clerk service status
   - **Rate limiting**: Check rate limit events
   - **Validation errors**: Review request data patterns

**Resolution Actions**:
- For database issues: Check connection pool, restart functions
- For auth issues: Verify Clerk webhook configuration
- For validation errors: Update validation logic or client requests
- For rate limiting: Adjust limits or implement queuing

### High Execution Time Alert

**Symptoms**: Average execution time >1 second

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check performance breakdown:
```sql
SELECT function_name, 
       AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_time,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY execution_time_ms) as p95_time,
       COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM function_performance_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
GROUP BY function_name
ORDER BY avg_time DESC;
```

2. Check for cold starts:
```sql
SELECT function_name, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN cold_start THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cold_starts,
       COUNT(*) as total_requests,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN cold_start THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*)) as cold_start_rate
FROM function_performance_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
GROUP BY function_name;
```

**Resolution Actions**:
- **High cold start rate**: Implement keep-warm strategy
- **Database queries**: Optimize slow queries, add indexes
- **External API calls**: Add timeout and retry logic
- **Large payloads**: Implement compression or pagination
- **Memory usage**: Profile and optimize memory-intensive operations

### Function Unavailable

**Symptoms**: Function returning 500 errors or not responding

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check function deployment status in Supabase dashboard
2. Review recent error logs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM function_error_events 
WHERE function_name = 'failing-function-name'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

3. Test function directly:
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/function-name"
```

**Resolution Actions**:
- Redeploy function if deployment issue
- Check environment variables and secrets
- Review recent code changes
- Scale up if resource exhaustion

### Security Alert Investigation

**Symptoms**: High-risk security events or suspicious activity

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check high-risk security events:
```sql
SELECT * FROM high_risk_security_events 
ORDER BY risk_score DESC, created_at DESC;
```

2. Analyze IP reputation:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ip_reputation 
WHERE reputation = 'HIGH_RISK'
ORDER BY avg_risk_score DESC;
```

3. Check JWT validation failures:
```sql
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) as failures
FROM security_events 
WHERE event_type = 'jwt_validation_failed'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY failures DESC;
```

**Resolution Actions**:
- Block suspicious IPs at CDN/firewall level
- Implement additional rate limiting
- Review authentication configuration
- Alert security team for investigation

## üîÑ Recovery Procedures

### Function Restart
```bash
# Redeploy specific function
supabase functions deploy function-name

# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy
```

### Database Connection Issues
```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Kill hanging queries
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction' 
  AND query_start < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### Cache Clear (if applicable)
```bash
# Clear function cache (implementation dependent)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/rpc/clear_function_cache"
```

FROM function_performance_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY function_name
HAVING AVG(execution_time_ms) > 1000
ORDER BY avg_time DESC;
```

### Memory Optimization
```sql
-- Check memory usage patterns
SELECT function_name, AVG(memory_used_mb) as avg_memory
FROM function_performance_metrics 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND memory_used_mb IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY function_name
ORDER BY avg_memory DESC;
```

### Cold Start Reduction
- Implement keep-warm strategies
- Optimize import statements and initialization
- Use lighter runtime dependencies
- Consider connection pooling
